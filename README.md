# autopilot

- I don't have Sketch, so I've imported the design into Figma. I suspect that some styling could be lost, because there is no `hover` or `selected` states. To implement these states I was guessing based on the attached screenshot, so `selected + hover` state doesn't feel right
- I split data into `pages` to justify the gray line delimeter in the design
- I added `type = 'person' | 'event'` field to the data model to justify the different icons
- I didn't bother with accessibility for the sake of speed and simplicity (used `div`s instead of `button` or `input`s)
